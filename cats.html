  <h1>The Tale of the Prince and the Bear</h1>

  <p>
    This is the story of our two cats, Prince (left, black &amp; white) and Bear
    (right, orange &amp; white, large). They were shipped to us from the deserts 
    of Arizona. (In carriers, with the owners, not in boxes as pictured.)
  </p>

  <p>
    They spent their first few days hiding in our bathroom, scared to come out.
    Despite usage of the room becoming very awkward for us, we tried to make 
    their brief stay as comfortable as possible (with a comfy towel).
  </p>

  <p>
    Within a week or two, though, they got used to our apartment and started
    lazing around as if they owned the place.
  </p>
  <img src="images/CatsUnderTable.jpg">
  <img src="images/CatsOnCounter.jpg">
  
  <p>
    They started to become a little <i>too</i> comfortable and trusting.
  </p>
  <img src="images/BearBurger.jpg">
  
  <p>
    Prince and Bear even started acting affectionate, as if they liked us.
  </p>

  <img src="images/BearHoldingFoot.jpg">
  
  <p>
    However, they weren't always so happy when we returned that affection.
  </p>

  <p>
    Supposedly, the two are brothers, despite having very different appearances
    (and weights!). They got along splendidly, eating together, playing 
    together, and sleeping together (the three main feline activities).

  <p>
    The two put up with our stupid shenanigans and puns for some reason.

  <p>
    And were quite perplexed when we tried to get them to drink more water.
  </p>
  <img src="images/CatsExaminingFountain.jpg">
  
  <p>
    As it turns out, they're not the biggest fans of drinking from fountains. 
    I'm surprised they're not thirsty after all the yoga they practice.

  <p>
    Also, It turns out that white cats are not ideal if you wear dark clothing.
  </p>
  <img src="images/PrinceOnBlackPants.jpg">
  
  <p>
    Occasionally, we had to leave them to go travel. Despite their wishes,
    apparently. Bear wanted to come with us.
  </p> 
  <img src="images/BearInSuitcase.jpg">
  
  <p>
    And Prince would wait dutifully by the door for us to return.
  </p>
  <img src="images/PrinceWaitingAtDoor.jpg">
  
  <p>
    Like most cats, they seemed to enjoy boxes.
  </p>
  <img src="images/CatsInCastles.jpg">
  <img src="images/CatsInBoxFromSide.jpg">
  <img src="images/BearInBox.jpg">
  
  <p>
    And their cat tree perches.
  </p>
  <img src="images/CatsInTree.jpg">
  
  <p>
    They also seemed to enjoy sitting on our clothes and shoes.
  </p>
  <img src="images/BearOnClothesPile.jpg">
  <img src="images/PrinceUnderShoes.jpg">
  <img src="images/BearInShoes.jpg">
  
  <p>
    Or even taking the place of our clothes.
  </p>
  <img src="images/CatsInDrawer.jpg">
  <img src="images/PrinceInGymBag.jpg">
  
  <p>
    And showing off their own coat.
  </p>
  <img src="images/BearSuperFluffy.jpg">
  
  <p>
    Which, by the way, requires a <i>lot</i> of work to keep clean. Luckily,
    Prince helps out.
  </p>
  <img src="images/CatsGrooming.gif">
  
  <p>
    Sometimes they drink a bit too much.
  </p>
  <img src="images/BearSniffingWine.jpg">
  
  <p>
    And end up too drunk to sit up anymore.
  </p>
  <img src="images/PrinceUpsideDown.jpg">
  <img src="images/BearUpsideDown.jpg">
  
  <p>
    After swearing off drinking, Bear decided to start a veggie cleanse.
  </p>
  <img src="images/BearLickingCarrot.jpg">
  
  <p>
    But, even after all of their silliness&mdash;Bear and Prince have turned out 
    to be an awesome pair of cats.
